  poncho:
    github: icyleaf/poncho
```

## Usage

require "poncho"
```

### Parse

Poncho parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use.
It accepts a String or IO and will return an `Hash` with the parsed keys and values.

#### Rules

Poncho parser currently supports the following rules:

- Skipped the empty line and comment(`#`).
- Ignore the comment which after (`#`).
- `NAME=foo` becomes `{"NAME" => "foo"}`.
- Empty values become empty strings.
- Whirespace is removed from right ends of the value.
- Single and Double quoted values are escaped.
- New lines are expanded if in double quotes.
- Inner quotes are maintained (such like json).
- Overwrite optional (default is non-overwrite).
- Only accpets string type value.

#### Examples

```crystal
poncho = Poncho.from_file ".env"
# or
poncho = Poncho.parse("ENV=development\nDB_NAME=poncho\nENV=production")
poncho["ENV"] # => "development"

# Overwrite the key
poncho = Poncho.parse!("ENV=development\nDB_NAME=poncho\nENV=production", overwrite: true)
poncho["ENV"] # => "production"
```
